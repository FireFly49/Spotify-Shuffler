This project is still under development. Will eventually be a website that 
can be used to achieve the same, avoiding creation of your own account 


To use this code, follow these steps: 

- Go to spotify for developers 
- Create an account / login
- Plug your client id and client secret into (Secret key is a long string of ASCII characters)
- Run the code and enjoy shuffling your playlists without spotify's biased shuffling
